This is an example of how to configure a Expo with Storybook.

The main idea is that you develop your UI components in isolation, promoting easier maintanability, testability and reuse of these components, while promoting consistency across even multiple applications.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Running Expo

```
yarn start
```

## Running Storybook

```
yarn storybook
```
